## Abstraction
Abstraction in python is defined as a process of handling complexity by hiding unnecessary information from the user. This is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages.

## Encapsulation
Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class.

## Polymorphism
The literal meaning of polymorphism is the condition of occurrence in different forms. Polymorphism is a very important concept in programming. It refers to the use of a single type entity (method, operator or object) to represent different types in different scenarios.

## Inheritance
Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class. Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class. Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.
